Extension for Chrome that Swaps video ads for an ad-free stream between 1080p and 480p.
YOU MUST DISABLE TTV LOL / PURPLE ADBLOCK FOR THIS EXTENSION TO WORK.

This video adblock for Twitch extension will swap Twitch video ads for an ad-free version of the stream between 1080p and 480p and then automatically switch back to the original video quality once the ad is finished. This is all done locally, no proxies, no VPN's and no third party websites. The extension does not collect nor share any personal information and is opensource, link is below. Works best when used with UBlock Origin, although this extension does also block some ad tracking URL's.
You MUST remove any other previous Twitch specific ad blockers or user-scripts in case of conflicts. For example, TTV LoL and Purple Ad-Block will override this extension and stop it from working. However this extension can be used with uBlock Origin (Without user-scripts installed).

If you have issues while using this extension, please note, some ad-blocker extensions may interfere with this extension.

The extension code is opensource and can be looked at here:
